What is Machine Learning?
One of our goals in this lesson is to help you get a clearer, more specific understanding of what machine learning is and how it differs from other approaches.w
Let's start with a classic definition. If you look up the term in a search engine, you might find something like this:
Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, behaviors, and trends.
Let's break that down a little. One important component of machine learning is that we are taking some data and using it to make predictions or identify important relationships. But looking for patterns in data is done in traditional data science as well. So how does machine learning differ? In this next video, we'll go over a few examples to illustrate the difference between machine learning and traditional programming.

Applications of Machine Learning
The applications of machine learning are extremely broad! And the opportunities cut across industry verticals. Whether the industry is healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, government, or education, there is enormous potential to apply machine learning to solve problems in more efficient and impactful ways.
We'll take a tour through some of the major areas where machine learning is applied, mainly just to give you an idea of the scope and type of problems that machine learning is commonly used to address.
Examples of Applied Machine Learning
Machine learning is used to solve an extremely diverse range of problems. For your reference, here are all the examples we discussed in the video, along with links to further reading in case you are curious and want to learn more about any of them:
Automate the recognition of disease
Trained physicians can only review and evaluate a limited volume of patients or patient images (X-rays, sonograms, etc.). Machine learning can be used to spot the disease, hence reducing physician burnout. For example, Google has trained a deep learning model to detect breast cancer and Stanford researchers have used deep learning models to diagnose skin cancer.
Recommend next best actions for individual care plans
With the mass digitization of patient data via systems that use EMRs (Electronic Medical Records) and EHRs (Electronic Health Records), machine learning can be used to help build effective individual care plans. For example, IBM Watson Oncology can help clinicians explore potential treatment options. More examples of how machine learning impacts healthcare can be found here.
Enable personalized, real-time banking experiences with chatbots
You've likely encountered this when you call a customer service number. Machine learning can be used to intercept and handle common, straightforward issues through chat and messaging services, so customers can quickly and independently resolve simple issues that would otherwise have required human intervention. With the chatbot, a customer can simply type in a question and the bot engages to surface the answer. Refer to this article to find more information about chatbot powered machine learning.
Identify the next best action for the customer
Real-time insights that incorporate machine learning tools—such as sentiment analysis—can help organizations assess the likelihood of a deal closing or the level of a customer’s loyalty. Personally-tailored recommendations powered by machine learning can engage and delight customers with information and offers that are relevant to them.
Capture, prioritize, and route service requests to the correct employee, and improve response times
A busy government organization gets innumerable service requests on an annual basis. Machine learning tools can help to capture incoming service requests, to route them to the correct employee in real-time, to refine prioritization, and improve response times.

The Data Science Process
Big data has become part of the lexicon of organizations worldwide, as more and more organizations look to leverage data to drive informed business decisions. With this evolution in business decision-making, the amount of raw data collected, along with the number and diversity of data sources, is growing at an astounding rate. This data presents enormous potential.
Raw data, however, is often noisy and unreliable and may contain missing values and outliers. Using such data for modeling can produce misleading results. For the data scientist, the ability to combine large, disparate data sets into a format more appropriate for analysis is an increasingly crucial skill.
The data science process typically starts with collecting and preparing the data before moving on to training, evaluating, and deploying a model. Let's have a look.

Common Types of Data
It's All Numerical in the End
Note that although we've described numerical data as a distinct category, it is actually involved in some way with all of the data types we've described. With the example of stock performance (above) the stock prices are numerical data points. So why do we give this as an example of "time-series data" rather than "numerical data"? It is the ordering of the numerical data points across points in time that leads us to call the data time-series data.
What is more, all data in machine learning eventually ends up being numerical, regardless of whether it is numerical in its original form, so it can be processed by machine learning algorithms.
For example, we may want to use gender information in the dataset to predict if an individual has heart disease. Before we can use this information with a machine learning algorithm, we need to transfer male vs. female into numbers, for instance, 1 means a person is male and 2 means a person is female, so it can be processed. Note here that the value 1 or 2 does not carry any meaning.
Another example would be using pictures uploaded by customers to identify if they are satisfied with the service. Pictures are not initially in numerical form but they will need to be transformed into RGB values, a set of numerical values ranging from 0 to 255, to be processed.

Tabular Data
In machine learning, the most common type of data you'll encounter is tabular data—that is, data that is arranged in a data table. This is essentially the same format as you work with when you look at data in a spreadsheet.
Here's an example of tabular data showing some different clothing products and their properties:

Vectors
It is important to know that in machine learning we ultimately always work with numbers or specifically vectors.
A vector is simply an array of numbers, such as (1, 2, 3)—or a nested array that contains other arrays of numbers, such as (1, 2, (1, 2, 3)).
Vectors are used heavily in machine learning. If you have taken a basic course in linear algebra, then you are probably in good shape to begin learning about how they are used in machine learning. But if linear algebra and vectors are totally new to you, there are some great free resources available to help you learn. You may want to have a look at Khan Academy's excellent introduction to the topic here or check out Udacity's free Linear Algebra Refresher Course.
For now, the main points you need to be aware of are that:
All non-numerical data types (such as images, text, and categories) must eventually be represented as numbers
In machine learning, the numerical representation will be in the form of an array of numbers—that is, a vector
As we go through this course, we'll look at some different ways to take non-numerical data and vectorize it (that is, transform it into vector form).

Scaling Data
SEND FEEDBACK
Scaling Data
Scaling data means transforming it so that the values fit within some range or scale, such as 0–100 or 0–1. There are a number of reasons why it is a good idea to scale your data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm.
Let's consider an example. Imagine you have an image represented as a set of RGB values ranging from 0 to 255. We can scale the range of the values from 0–255 down to a range of 0–1. This scaling process will not affect the algorithm output since every value is scaled in the same way. But it can speed up the training process, because now the algorithm only needs to handle numbers less than or equal to 1.
Two common approaches to scaling data include standardization and normalization.
Standardization
Standardization rescales data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
The formula for this is:
(𝑥 − 𝜇)/𝜎
We subtract the mean (𝜇) from each value (x) and then divide by the standard deviation (𝜎). To understand why this works, it helps to look at an example. Suppose that we have a sample that contains three data points with the following values:
50  
100  
150  
 
The mean of our data would be 100, while the sample standard deviation would be 50.
Let's try standardizing each of these data points. The calculations are:
(50 − 100)/50 = -50/50 = -1
(100 − 100)/50 = 0/50 = 0
(150 − 100)/50 = 50/50 = 1
 
Thus, our transformed data points are:
-1  
0  
1
 
Again, the result of the standardization is that our data distribution now has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Normalization
Normalization rescales the data into the range [0, 1].
The formula for this is:
(𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛)/(𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛)
For each individual value, you subtract the minimum value (𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛) for that input in the training dataset, and then divide by the range of the values in the training dataset. The range of the values is the difference between the maximum value (𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥) and the minimum value (𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛).
Let's try working through an example with those same three data points:
50  
100  
150  
 
The minimum value (𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛) is 50, while the maximum value (𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥) is 150. The range of the values is 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 150 − 50 = 100.
Plugging everything into the formula, we get:
(50 − 50)/100 = 0/100 = 0
(100 − 50)/100 = 50/100 = 0.5
(150 − 50)/100 = 100/100 = 1
 
Thus, our transformed data points are:
0
0.5  
1
 
Again, the goal was to rescale our data into values ranging from 0 to 1—and as you can see, that's exactly what the formula did.

Encoding Categorical Data
As we've mentioned a few times now, machine learning algorithms need to have data in numerical form. Thus, when we have categorical data, we need to encode it in some way so that it is represented numerically.
There are two common approaches for encoding categorical data: ordinal encoding and one hot encoding.
Ordinal Encoding
In ordinal encoding, we simply convert the categorical data into integer codes ranging from 0 to (number of categories – 1). Let's look again at our example table of clothing products:
SKU
Make
Color
Quantity
Price
908721
Guess
Blue
789
45.33
456552
Tillys
Red
244
22.91
789921
A&F
Green
387
25.92
872266
Guess
Blue
154
17.56
If we apply ordinal encoding to the Make property, we get the following:
Make
Encoding
A&F
0
Guess
1
Tillys
2
And if we apply it to the Color property, we get:
Color
Encoding
Red
0
Green
1
Blue

Using the above encoding, the transformed table is shown below:
SKU
Make
Color
Quantity
Price
908721

789
45.33
456552

789921

387
25.92
872266

2
154
17.56
One of the potential drawbacks to this approach is that it implicitly assumes an order across the categories. In the above example, Blue (which is encoded with a value of 2) seems to be more than Red (which is encoded with a value of 1), even though this is in fact not a meaningful way of comparing those values. This is not necessarily a problem, but it is a reason to be cautious in terms of how the encoded data is used.
One-Hot Encoding
One-hot encoding is a very different approach. In one-hot encoding, we transform each categorical value into a column. If there are n categorical values, n new columns are added. For example, the Color property has three categorical values: Red, Green, and Blue, so three new columns Red, Green, and Blue are added.
If an item belongs to a category, the column representing that category gets the value 1, and all other columns get the value 0. For example, item 908721 (first row in the table) has the color blue, so we put 1 into that Blue column for 908721 and 0 into the Red and Green columns. Item 456552 (second row in the table) has color red, so we put 1 into that Red column for 456552 and 0 into the Green and Blue columns.
If we do the same thing for the Make property, our table can be transformed as follows:
SKU
A&F
Guess
Tillys
Red
Green
Blue
Quantity
Price
908721

One drawback of one-hot encoding is that it can potentially generate a very large number of columns.

mage Data
Images are another example of a data type that is commonly used as input in machine learning problems—but that isn't initially in numerical format. So, how do we represent an image as numbers? Let's have a look.
Taking a Closer Look at Image Data
Let's look a little closer at how an image can be encoded numerically. If you zoom in on an image far enough, you can see that it consists of small tiles, called pixels:

The color of each pixel is represented with a set of values:
In grayscale images, each pixel can be represented by a single number, which typically ranges from 0 to 255. This value determines how dark the pixel appears (e.g., 0 is black, while 255 is bright white).
In colored images, each pixel can be represented by a vector of three numbers (each ranging from 0 to 255) for the three primary color channels: red, green, and blue. These three red, green, and blue (RGB) values are used together to decide the color of that pixel. For example, purple might be represented as 128, 0, 128 (a mix of moderately intense red and blue, with no green).
The number of channels required to represent the color is known as the color depth or simply depth. With an RGB image, depth = 3, because there are three channels (Red, Green, and Blue). In contrast, a grayscale image has depth = 1, because there is only one channel.
Encoding an Image
Let's now talk about how we can use this data to encode an image. We need to know the following three things about an image to reproduce it:
Horizontal position of each pixel
Vertical position of each pixel
Color of each pixel
Thus, we can fully encode an image numerically by using a vector with three dimensions. The size of the vector required for any given image would be the height * width * depth of that image.
QUESTION 1 OF 2
Assume this figure is the numerical representation of an RGB image in the red channel:

Each of the squares represents one pixel and the value in the square is the pixel value.
Which of these statements is incorrect?
This image can be encoded by a vector with the dimension of 4*4*3
The total number of pixels in this image is 48
The numerical representation of the image in the green channel has the dimension of 4*4
The image has uniform aspect ratio but may need to be normalized.
SUBMIT
QUESTION 2 OF 2
There is a square shaped RGB image that consists of 900 pixels. Which of the following statements are correct?
Without any preprocessing, the image can be encoded by a 3-dimension vector with the dimension 45*20*3
This image has a dimension of 30*30
If the image is cropped to half of the original size, it can be encoded by a vector with the dimension 15*15*2
If the image is converted to grayscale, it can be encoded by a vector with the dimension 30*30*1
SUBMIT
Other Preprocessing Steps
In addition to encoding an image numerically, we may also need to do some other preprocessing steps. Generally, we would want to ensure that the input images have a uniform aspect ratio (e.g., by making sure all of the input images are square in shape) and are normalized (e.g. subtract mean pixel value in a channel from each pixel value in that channel). Some other preprocessing operations we might want to do to clean the input images include rotation, cropping, resizing, denoising, and centering the image.
 






Text Data
Text is another example of a data type that is initially non-numerical and that must be processed before it can be fed into a machine learning algorithm. Let's have a look at some of the common tasks we might do as part of this processing.
Normalization
One of the challenges that can come up in text analysis is that there are often multiple forms that mean the same thing. For example, the verb to be may show up as is, am, are, and so on. Or a document may contain alternative spellings of a word, such as behavior vs. behaviour. So one step that you will sometimes conduct in processing text is normalization.
Text normalization is the process of transforming a piece of text into a canonical (official) form.
Lemmatization is an example of normalization. A lemma is the dictionary form of a word and lemmatization is the process of reducing multiple inflections to that single dictionary form. For example, we can apply this to the is, am, are example we mentioned above:
Original word
Lemmatized word
is
be
are
be
am
be
In many cases, you may also want to remove stop words. Stop words are high-frequency words that are unnecessary (or unwanted) during the analysis. For example, when you enter a query like which cookbook has the best pancake recipe into a search engine, the words which and the are far less relevant than cookbook, pancake, and recipe. In this context, we might want to consider which and the to be stop words and remove them prior to analysis.
Here's another example:
Original text
Normalized text
The quick fox.
[quick, fox]
The lazzy dog.
[lazy, dog]
The rabid hare.
[rabid, hare]
Here we have tokenized the text (i.e., split each string of text into a list of smaller parts or tokens), removed stop words (the), and standardized spelling (changing lazzy to lazy).
QUESTION 1 OF 5
Here's another example:
Original text
Normalized text
Mary had a little lamb.
[Mary, have, a, little, lamb]
Jack and Jill went up the hill.
[Jack, and, Jill, go, up, the, hill]
London bridge is falling down.
[London, bridge, be, fall, down]
Looking at the normalized text, which of the following have been done?
Tokenization
Removal of stop words
Lemmatization
SUBMIT
Vectorization
After we have normalized the text, we can take the next step of actually encoding it in a numerical form. The goal here is to identify the particular features of the text that will be relevant to us for the particular task we want to perform—and then get those features extracted in a numerical form that is accessible to the machine learning algorithm. Typically this is done by text vectorization—that is, by turning a piece of text into a vector. Remember, a vector is simply an array of numbers—so there are many different ways that we can vectorize a word or a sentence, depending on how we want to use it. Common approaches include:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization
Word embedding, as done with Word2vec or Global Vectors (GloVe)
The details of these approaches are a bit outside the scope of this class, but let's take a closer look at TF-IDF as an example. The approach of TF-IDF is to give less importance to words that contain less information and are common in documents, such as "the" and "this"—and to give higher importance to words that contain relevant information and appear less frequently. Thus TF-IDF assigns weights to words that signify their relevance in the documents.
Here's what the word importance might look like if we apply it to our example


quick
fox
lazy
dog
rabid
hare
the


0.32
0.23
0.12
0.23
0.56
0.12
0.0
Here's what that might look like if we apply it to the normalized text:


quick
fox
lazy
dog
rabid
hare
[quick, fox]
0.32
0.23
0.0

0.23
0.0
0.0
[rabid, hare]
0.0
0.0
0.0
0.0
0.56
0.12
Noticed that "the" is removed since it has 0 importance here.
Each chunk of text gets a vector (represented here as a row in the table) that is the length of the total number of words that we are interested in (in this case, six words). If the normalized text does not have the word in question, then the value in that position is 0, whereas if it does have the word in question, it gets assigned to the importance of the word.
QUESTION 2 OF 5
Let's pause to make sure this idea is clear. In the table above, what does the value 0.56 mean?
It means that the word fox has some importance in [quick, fox].
It means that the word rabid has some importance in [quick, fox].
It means that the word fox has some importance in [rabid, hare].
It means that the word rabid has some importance in [rabid, hare].

Feature Extraction
As we talked about earlier, the text in the example can be represented by vectors with length 6 since there are 6 words total.
[quick, fox] as (0.32, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
[lazy, dog] as (0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0)
[rabid, hare] as (0.0, 0.0, 0.0 , 0.0, 0.56, 0.12)
We understand the text because each word has a meaning. But how do algorithms understand the text using the vectors, in other words, how do algorithms extract features from the vectors?
Vectors with length n can be visualized as a line in an n dimension space. For example, a vector (1,1) can be viewed as a line starting from (0, 0) and ending at (1,1).

Any vector with the same length can be visualized in the same space. How close one vector is to another can be calculated as vector distance. If two vectors are close to each other, we can say the text represented by the two vectors have a similar meaning or have some connections. For example, if we add [lazy, fox] to our example:


quick
fox
lazy
dog
rabid
hare
[quick, fox]
0.32

Apparently, [lazy, fox] is more similar to [lazy, dog] than [rabid, hare], so the vector distance of [lazy, fox] and [lazy, dog] is smaller than that to [lazy, fox] and [rabid, hare].
QUESTION 4 OF 5

The Whole Pipeline
In this next video, we'll first review the above steps—normalization and vectorization—and then talk about how they fit into the larger goal of training a machine-learning model to analyze text data.
In summary, a typical pipeline for text data begins by pre-processing or normalizing the text. This step typically includes tasks such as breaking the text into sentence and word tokens, standardizing the spelling of words, and removing overly common words (called stop words).
The next step is feature extraction and vectorization, which creates a numeric representation of the documents. Common approaches include TF-IDF vectorization, Word2vec, and Global Vectors (GloVe).
Last, we will feed the vectorized document and labels into a model and start the training.

QUESTION 5 OF 5
What is the typical pipeline for a classification model using text data?

Two Perspectives on ML
Computer science vs. Statistical perspective
As you can see, data plays a central role in how problems are modeled in machine learning. In very broad terms, we can think of machine learning as a matter of using some data (perhaps historical data that we already have on hand) to train a model. Then, once the model is trained, we can feed it new input data and have it tell us something useful.
So the general idea is that we create models and then feed data into these models to generate outputs. These outputs might be, for example, predictions for future trends or patterns in the data.
This idea draws on work not only from computer science, but also statistics—and as a result, you will often see the same underlying machine learning concepts described using different terms. For example, a computer scientist might say something like:
We are using input features to create a program that can generate the desired output.
In contrast, someone with a background in statistics might be inclined to say something more like:
We are trying to find a mathematical function that, given the values of the independent variables can predict the values of the dependent variables.
While the terminology are different, the challenges are the same, that is how to get the best possible outcome.

In the end, having an understanding of the underlying concepts is more important than memorizing the terms used to describe those concepts. However, it's still essential to be familiar with the terminology so that you don't get confused when talking with people from different backgrounds.
Over the next couple of pages, we'll take a look at these two different perspectives and get familiar with some of the related terminology.

The Computer Science Perspective
Computer science terminology
As we discussed earlier, one of the simplest ways we can organize data for machine learning is in a table, like the table of clothing products we looked at earlier in this lesson:
SKU
Make
Color
Quantity
Price
908721
Guess
Blue
789
45.33
456552
Tillys
Red
244
22.91
789921
A&F
Green
387
25.92
872266
Guess
Blue
154
17.56
What are some of the terms we can use to describe this data?
For the rows in the table, we might call each row an entity or an observation about an entity. In our example above, each entity is simply a product, and when we speak of an observation, we are simply referring to the data collected about a given product. You'll also sometimes see a row of data referred to as an instance, in the sense that a row may be considered a single example (or instance) of data.
For the columns in the table, we might refer to each column as a feature or attribute which describes the property of an entity. In the above example, color and quantity are features (or attributes) of the products.
Input and output
Remember that in a typical case of machine learning, you have some kind of input which you feed into the machine learning algorithm, and the algorithm produces some output. In most cases, there are multiple pieces of data being used as input. For example, we can think of a single row from the above table as a vector of data points:
(908721, Guess, Blue, 789, 45.33)
 
Again, in computer science terminology, each element of the input vector (such as Guess or Blue) is referred to as an attribute or feature. Thus, we might feed these input features into our machine learning program and the program would then generate some kind of desired output (such as a prediction about how well the product will sell). This can be represented as:
Output = Program(Input Features)
 
An important step in preparing your data for machine learning is extracting the relevant features from the raw data. (The topic of feature extraction is an important one that we'll dive into in greater detail in a later lesson.)

The Statistical Perspective
Statistical terminology
In statistics, you'll also see the data described in terms of independent variables and dependent variables. These names come from the idea that the value of one variable may depend on the value of some other variables. For example, the selling price of a house is the dependent variable that depends on some independent variables—like the house's location and size.
In the example of clothing products we looked at earlier in this lesson:
SKU
Make
Color
Quantity
Price
908721
Guess
Blue
789
45.33
456552

25.92

Guess
Blue

17.56
We might use data in each row (e.g. (908721, Guess, Blue, 789, 45.33)) to predict the sale of the corresponding item. Thus, the sale of each item is dependent on the data in each row. We can call the data in each row the independent variables and call the sale the dependent variable.
Input and output
From a statistical perspective, the machine learning algorithm is trying to learn a hypothetical function (f) such that:
Output Variable = f(Input Variables)
 
Typically, the independent variables are the input, and the dependent variables are the output. Thus, the above formula can also be expressed as:
Dependent Variable = f(Independent Variables)
 
In other words, we are feeding the independent variables into the function, and the function is giving us the resulting values of the dependent variables. With the housing example, we might want to have a function that can take the independent variables of size and location as input and use these to predict the likely selling price of the house as output.
Yet another way to represent this concept is to use shorthand notation. Often, the input variables are denoted as X and the output variable is denoted as Y:
Y = f(X)
 
In the case of multiple input variables, X would be an input vector, meaning that it would be composed of multiple individual inputs (e.g. (908721, Guess, Blue, 789, 45.33)). When this is the case, you'll see the individual inputs denoted with a subscript, as in X1, X2, X3, and so on.

The Tools for Machine Learning
Many tools have been developed to make machine learning more powerful and easier to implement. On this page, we'll take a look at the typical components you might employ in a machine learning ecosystem. You don't need to understand the details of these tools at this stage, and we don't assume you've had previous experience with them. Our goal at this point is simply to give you some idea of what some of the popular tools are and how they relate to one another.
The Machine Learning Ecosystem
A typical machine learning ecosystem is made up of three main components:
1. Libraries. When you're working on a machine learning project, you likely will not want to write all of the necessary code yourself—instead, you'll want to make use of code that has already been created and refined. That's where libraries come in. A library is a collection of pre-written (and compiled) code that you can make use of in your own project. NumPy is an example of a library popularly used in data science, while TensorFlow is a library specifically designed for machine learning. Read this article for some other useful library.
2. Development environments. A development environment is a software application (or sometimes a group of applications) that provide a whole suite of tools designed to help you (as the developer or machine learning engineer) build out your projects. Jupyter Notebooks and Visual Studio are examples of development environments that are popular for coding many different types of projects, including machine learning projects.
3. Cloud services. A cloud service is a service that offers data storage or computing power over the Internet. In the context of machine learning, you can use a cloud service to access a server that is likely far more powerful than your own machine, or that comes equipped with machine learning models that are ready for you to use. Read more information about different cloud services from this article
For each of these components, there are multiple options you can choose from. Let's have a look at some examples.
Notebooks
Notebooks are originally created as a documenting tool that others can use to reproduce experiments. Notebooks typically contain a combination of runnable code, output, formatted text, and visualizations. One of the most popular open-source notebooks used today by data scientists and data science engineers is Jupyter notebook, which can combine code, formatted text (markdown) and visualization.
Notebooks contains several independent cells that allow for the execution of code snippets within those cells. The output of each cell can be saved in the notebook and viewed by others.
End-to-end with Azure
You can analyze and train a small amount of data with your local machine using Jupyter notebook, Visual studio, or other tools. But with very large amounts of data, or you need a faster processor, it's a better idea to train and test the model remotely using cloud services such as Microsoft Azure. You can use Azure Data Science Virtual Machine, Azure Databricks, Azure Machine Learning Compute, or SQL server ML services to train and test models and use Azure Kubernetes to deploy models.

Libraries for Machine Learning
For your reference, here are all the libraries we went over in the video. This is a lot of info; you should not feel like you need to be deeply knowledgable about every detail of these libraries. Rather, we suggest that you become familiar with what each library is for, in general terms. For example, if you hear someone talking about matplotlib, it would be good for you to recognize that this is a popular library for data visualization. Or if you see a reference to TensorFlow, it would be good to recognize this as a popular machine learning library.
Core Framework and Tools
Python is a very popular high-level programming language that is great for data science. Its ease of use and wide support within popular machine learning platforms, coupled with a large catalog of ML libraries, has made it a leader in this space.
Pandas is an open-source Python library designed for analyzing and manipulating data. It is particularly good for working with tabular data and time-series data.
NumPy, like Pandas, is a Python library. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays of data, and has many high-level mathematical functions that can be used to perform operations on these arrays.
Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Scikit-Learn is a Python library designed specifically for machine learning. It is designed to be integrated with other scientific and data-analysis libraries, such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib (described below).
Apache Spark is an open-source analytics engine that is designed for cluster-computing and that is often used for large-scale data processing and big data.
TensorFlow is a free, open-source software library for machine learning built by Google Brain.
Keras is a Python deep-learning library. It provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to interface with other libraries, such as TensorFlow, in order to program neural networks. Keras is designed for rapid development and experimentation.
PyTorch is an open source library for machine learning, developed in large part by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is known for being comparatively easy to use, especially for developers already familiar with Python and a Pythonic code style.
Data Visualization
Plotly is not itself a library, but rather a company that provides a number of different front-end tools for machine learning and data science—including an open source graphing library for Python.
Matplotlib is a Python library designed for plotting 2D visualizations. It can be used to produce graphs and other figures that are high quality and usable in professional publications. You'll see that the Matplotlib library is used by a number of other libraries and tools, such as SciKit Learn (above) and Seaborn (below). You can easily import Matplotlib for use in a Python script or to create visualizations within a Jupyter Notebook.
Seaborn is a Python library designed specifically for data visualization. It is based on matplotlib, but provides a more high-level interface and has additional features for making visualizations more attractive and informative.
Bokeh is an interactive data visualization library. In contrast to a library like matplotlib that generates a static image as its output, Bokeh generates visualizations in HTML and JavaScript. This allows for web-based visualizations that can have interactive features.

Models vs. Algorithms
In machine learning, the key distinction of a model and an algorithm is:
Models are the specific representations learned from data
Algorithms are the processes of learning
We can think of the algorithm as a function—we give the algorithm data and it produces a model:
Model = Algorithm(Data)
Model=Algorithm(Data)
On the next page, we'll look at this distinction in the context of a concrete example: Linear regression.
More About Machine Learning Algorithms
We can think of an algorithm as a mathematical tool that can usually be represented by an equation as well as implemented in code. For example, y = Wx + b is an algorithm that can be used to calculate y from x if the values for W and b are known. But how do we get W and b?
This is the learning part of machine learning; That is, we can learn these values from training data. For example, suppose the following data are collected:
x
y
1
1
2
2
3
3
We can plug the data into the algorithm and calculate W = 1 and b = 0. We would say that that the algorithm was run on the data and learned the values ofr W and b. The output of the learning process is W = 1 and b = 0.
Machine Learning Models
Machine learning models are outputs or specific representations of algorithms that run on data. A model represents what is learned by a machine learning algorithm on the data.
In the previous example, y = 1*x + 0 is the model we obtained from running the algorithm y = Wx + b on the training data. We can also say that y = 1*x + 0 is the model that can be used to predict y from x.
A machine learning model can also be written in a set of weights or coefficients instead of a full equation. Looking at the previous example, since we know the algorithm, it is redundant to keep the full equation y = 1*x + 0. All we need are the weights (or coefficients) W = 1 and b = 0. Thus, we can also think of a model as a set of weights (or coefficients) that have been learned.

Linear Regression
In our first lab, we're going to use Azure Machine Learning Studio to train a model using one of the fundamental machine learning algorithms: Linear regression. Before we dive into the lab, let's review what linear regression is and how it can be used to train a model.
The video below gives a brief review of the main concepts. If you've never seen linear regression before, or need a more thorough review, you can continue on for a detailed explanation below.
If you feel confident in your understanding of linear regression, feel free to move ahead to the next page and get started on the lab. Otherwise, we'll go over the concepts in further detail below.
Understanding Linear Regression
As the term suggests, linear regression is an algorithm that uses a straight line (or plane) to describe relationships between variables.
Let's consider a very simple example of a linear relationship. Suppose that we want to know if the number of hours a student spends studying for a test is related to the number of questions answered correctly on the test.
Such a relationship might look something like this:

We can see that there is a clear relationship: Students who spent more time studying also scored higher on the test.
What is more, we can see that the data points cluster around a straight line. Linear regression is all about finding the line that best fits the data. And this model (or line) can then be used to make predictions. In this case, if we know the number of hours a student has studied for the test, we can predict how many questions he or she can answer correctly. To make this prediction, we need the equation for the line of best fit. What would that look like?
Simple Linear Regression
You may recall from fundamental algebra that the general equation for a line looks like this:
y = m x + b
y=mx+b
Where 
m
m is called the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept. Again, this is the general equation. For a specific line, we need to know the values for the slope and y-intercept. For example, the following equations represent three different lines.
y = 10 x + 50
y=10x+50
y = 2 x + 3
y=2x+3
y = -10 x + 40
y=−10x+40
Equations like these can be used to make predictions. Once we know 
m
m and 
b
b , we can feed in a value for 
x
x and the equation will give us the value of 
y
y.
QUESTION 1 OF 2
For the earlier example of students studying for a test, suppose that we find that the line of best fit is:
y = 15 x + 3
y=15x+3
Where 
x
x is the number of hours studied and 
y
y is the number of questions correctly answered.
If a student studied 10 hours for the test, what is their predicted score?

y = 15 x + 3
y=15x+3 is a model
y = 15 x + 3

SUBMIT
Linear Regression in Machine Learning
The equation we used above was:
y = mx + b
y=mx+b
In algebraic terms, we may refer to 
m
m as the coefficient of x or simply the slope of the line, and we may call 
b
b the y-intercept. In machine learning, you will typically see the y-intercept referred to as the bias. In machine learning, you will also often see the equation represented using different variables, as in:
y = B_0 + B_1*x
y=B
0
​
+B
1
​
∗x
The letters are different and the order has been changed, but it is exactly the same equation. Thus, we can see that what we know from algebra as the basic equation for a line is also, in machine learning, the equation used for simple linear regression.
Multiple Linear Regression
In more complex cases where there is more than one input variable, we might see something like this:
y = B_0 + B_1*x_1 + B_2*x_2 + B_3*x_3 ... + B_n *x_n
y=B
0
​
+B

2
​
∗x
2
​
+B
3
​
∗x
3
​
...+B
n
​
∗x
n
​
In this case, we are using multiple input variables to predict the output. When we have multiple input variables like this, we call it multiple linear regression. The visualization of multiple linear regression is no longer a simple line, but instead a plane in multiple dimensions:

But don't let any of this intimidate you: The core idea is still that we are modeling a relationship (using a line or plane) in order to help us predict the value of some variable that we are interested in.
Training a Linear Regression Model
To "train a linear regression model" simply means to learn the coefficients and bias that best fit the data. This is the purpose of the linear regression algorithm. Here we will give you a high-level introduction so that you understand conceptually how it works, but we will not go into the mathematical details.
The Cost Function
Notice from our example of test scores earlier that the line we came up with did not perfectly fit the data. In fact, most of the data points were not on the line! When we predict that a student who studies for 10 hours will get a score of 153, we do not expect their score to be exactly 153. Put another way, when we make a prediction using the line, we expect the prediction to have some error.
The process of finding the best model is essentially a process of finding the coefficients and bias that minimize this error. To calculate this error, we use a cost function. There are many cost functions you can choose from to train a model and the resulting error will be different depending one which cost function you choose. The most commonly used cost function for linear regression is the root mean squared error (RMSE)
Preparing the Data
There are several assumptions or conditions you need to keep in mind when you use the linear regression algorithm. If the raw data does not meet these assumptions, then it needs to be prepared and transformed prior to use.
Linear assumption: As we've said earlier, linear regression describes variables using a line. So the relationship between the input variables and the output variable needs to be a linear relationship. If the raw data does not follow a linear relationship, you may be able to transform) your data prior to using it with the linear regression algorithm. For example, if your data has an exponential relationship, you can use log transformation.
Remove collinearity: When two variables are collinear, this means they can be modeled by the same line or are at least highly correlated; in other words, one input variable can be accurately predicted by the other. For example, suppose we want to predict education level using the input variables number of years studying at school, if an individual is male, and if an individual is female. In this case, we will see collinearity—the input variable if an individual is female can be perfectly predicted by if an individual is male, thus, we can say they are highly correlated. Having highly correlated input variables will make the model less consistent, so it's important to perform a correlation check among input variables and remove highly correlated input variables.
Gaussian (normal) distribution: Linear regression assumes that the distance between output variables and real data (called residual) is normally distributed. If this is not the case in the raw data, you will need to first transform the data so that the residual has a normal distribution.
Rescale data: Linear regression is very sensitive to the distance among data points, so it's always a good idea to normalize or standardize the data.
Remove noise: Linear regression is very sensitive to noise and outliers in the data. Outliers will significantly change the line learned, as shown in the picture below. Thus, cleaning the data is a critical step prior to applying linear regression.

Calculating the Coefficients
We've discussed here the overall concept of training a linear regression model: We take the general equation for a line and use some data to learn the coefficients for a specific line that will best fit the data. Just so that you have an idea of what this looks like in concrete terms, let's look at the formulas used to calculate the coefficients. We're showing these in order to give you a general idea of what the calculations actually involve on a concrete level. For this course, you do not need to worry about how the formulas are derived and how to use them to calculate the coefficients.
The formula for getting the slope of the line looks something like this:

To get the intercept, we calculate:

And to get the root mean squared error (RMSE), we have:

In most machine learning libraries (such as Sklearn or Pythorch) the inner workings of the linear regression algorithm are implemented for you. The error and the best coefficients will be automatically calculated when you input the data. Here, the important thing is to understand what is happening conceptually—namely, that we choose a cost function (like RMSE) to calculate the error and then minimize that error in order to arrive at a line of best fit that models the training data and can be used to make predictions.
Now that we've review the concept, let's get some hands-on practice implementing the linear regression algorithm in Azure Machine Learning Studio!

Learning a function
As mentioned earlier, we can generally think of a machine learning algorithm as a process for learning, and models as specific representations that we train using data. In essence, machine learning algorithms aim to learn a target function (
f
f) that describes the mapping between data input variables (
X
X) and an output variable (
Y
Y).
Y = f(X)
Y=f(X)
The core goal is to learn a useful transformation of the input data that gets us closer to the expected output.
Since the process extrapolates from a limited set of values, there will always be an error 
e
e which is independent of the input data (
X
X) such that:
Y = f(X) + e
Y=f(X)+e
The variable 
e
e is called irreducible error because no matter how good we get at estimating the target function (
f
f), we cannot reduce this error.
Note that the irreducible error we're discussing here is different from the model error we talked about earlier in the lesson. Irreducible error is caused by the data collection process—such as when we don't have enough data or don't have enough data features. In contrast, the model error measures how much the prediction made by the model is different from the true output. The model error is generated from the model and can be reduced during the model learning process.

Parametric vs. Non-parametric
Based on the assumptions about the shape and structure of the function they try to learn, machine learning algorithms can be divided into two categories: parametric and nonparametric.
Parametric Machine Learning Algorithms
Parametric machine learning algorithms make assumptions about the mapping function and have a fixed number of parameters. No matter how much data is used to learn the model, this will not change how many parameters the algorithm has. With a parametric algorithm, we are selecting the form of the function and then learning its coefficients using the training data.
An example of this would be the approach used in linear regression algorithms, where the simplified functional form can be something like:
B_0 + B_1 * X_1 + B_2 * X_2 = 0
B
0
​
+B
1
​
∗X
1
​
+B
2
​
∗X
2
​
=0
This assumption greatly simplifies the learning process; after selecting the initial function, the remaining problem is simply to estimate the coefficients B0, B1, and B2 using different samples of input variables X1 and X2.
Benefits:
Simpler and easier to understand; easier to interpret the results
Faster when talking about learning from data
Less training data required to learn the mapping function, working well even if the fit to data is not perfect
Limitations:
Highly constrained to the specified form of the simplified function
Limited complexity of the problems they are suitable for
Poor fit in practice, unlikely to match the underlying mapping function.
Non-parametric Machine Learning Algorithms
Non-parametric algorithms do not make assumptions regarding the form of the mapping function between input data and output. Consequently, they are free to learn any functional form from the training data.
A simple example is the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which we'll discuss in more detail later in the course. KNN does not make any assumptions about the functional form, but instead uses the pattern that points have similar output when they are close.
Benefits:
High flexibility, in the sense that they are capable of fitting a large number of functional forms
Power by making weak or no assumptions on the underlying function
High performance in the prediction models that are produced
Limitations:
More training data is required to estimate the mapping function
Slower to train, generally having far more parameters to train
Overfitting the training data is a risk; overfitting makes it harder to explain the resulting predictions
QUESTION 1 OF 3
Which of these sentences are true statements about Machine Learning? (Select all that apply.)
Parametric machine learning algorithms are most suitable for solving more complex problems—as opposed to nonparametric algorithms, which work great in low-complexity scenarios.
When there is less training data available, simplifying the form of the mapping function to a linear regression model would be the way to go.
Non-parametric algorithms do not make assumptions regarding the form of the mapping between input data and output, so they are free to learn any functional form from the training data.

Approaches to Machine Learning
There are three main approaches to machine learning:
Supervised learning
Unsupervised learning
Reinforcement learning
We'll take a short, high-level look at these approaches here, and then revisit them in more detail in later lessons.
Supervised learning
Learns from data that contains both the inputs and expected outputs (e.g., labeled data). Common types are:
Classification: Outputs are categorical.
Regression: Outputs are continuous and numerical.
Similarity learning: Learns from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar two objects are.
Feature learning: Learns to automatically discover the representations or features from raw data.
Anomaly detection: A special form of classification, which learns from data labeled as normal/abnormal.
Unsupervised learning
Learns from input data only; finds hidden structure in input data.
Clustering: Assigns entities to clusters or groups.
Feature learning: Features are learned from unlabeled data.
Anomaly detection: Learns from unlabeled data, using the assumption that the majority of entities are normal.
Reinforcement learning
Learns how an agent should take action in an environment in order to maximize a reward function.
Markov decision process: A mathematical process to model decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. Does not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model.
The main difference between reinforcement learning and other machine learning approaches is that reinforcement learning is an active process where the actions of the agent influence the data observed in the future, hence influencing its own potential future states. In contrast, supervised and unsupervised learning approaches are passive processes where learning is performed without any actions that could influence the data.

The Trade-Offs
As all things in computer science, machine learning involves certain trade-offs. Two of the most important are bias vs. variance and overfitting vs. underfitting.
Bias vs. Variance
Bias measures how inaccurate the model prediction is in comparison with the true output. It is due to erroneous assumptions made in the machine learning process to simplify the model and make the target function easier to learn. High model complexity tends to have a low bias.
Variance measures how much the target function will change if different training data is used. Variance can be caused by modeling the random noise in the training data. High model complexity tends to have a high variance.
As a general trend, parametric and linear algorithms often have high bias and low variance, whereas non-parametric and non-linear algorithms often have low bias and high variance
Overfitting vs. Underfitting
Overfitting refers to the situation in which models fit the training data very well, but fail to generalize to new data.
Underfitting refers to the situation in which models neither fit the training data nor generalize to new data.
QUESTION 1 OF 4
Here are the main terms we just discussed. See if you can match each of them with its description.
Submit to check your answer choices!
DESCRIPTION
TERM
Error that occurs when the model is too sensitive to the training data (thus giving different estimates when given new training data)
Variance
Modeling the training data well, but not generalizing well to new data
Overfitting
failing to model the training data and failing to generalize to new data
Underfitting
Error that results from inaccurate assumptions in model training (that are made to simplify the training process)
Bias
SUBMIT
Bias vs. Variance Trade-off
The prediction error can be viewed as the sum of model error (error coming from the model) and the irreducible error (coming from data collection).
prediction error = Bias error + variance + error + irreducible error
 
Low bias means fewer assumptions about the target function. Some examples of algorithms with low bias are KNN and decision trees. Having fewer assumptions can help generalize relevant relations between features and target outputs. In contrast, high bias means more assumptions about the target function. Linear regression would be a good example (e.g., it assumes a linear relationship). Having more assumptions can potentially miss important relations between features and outputs and cause underfitting.
Low variance indicates changes in training data would result in similar target functions. For example, linear regression usually has a low variance. High variance indicates changes in training data would result in very different target functions. For example, support vector machines usually have a high variance. High variance suggests that the algorithm learns the random noise instead of the output and causes overfitting.
Generally, increasing model complexity would decrease bias error since the model has more capacity to learn from the training data. But the variance error would increase if the model complexity increases, as the model may begin to learn from noise in the training data.
The goal of training machine learning models is to achieve low bias and low variance. The optimal model complexity is where bias error crosses with variance error.
Overfitting vs. Underfitting
k-fold cross-validation: it split the initial training data into k subsets and train the model k times. In each training, it uses one subset as the testing data and the rest as training data.
hold back a validation dataset from the initial training data to estimatete how well the model generalizes on new data.
simplify the model. For example, using fewer layers or less neurons to make the neural network smaller.
use more data.
reduce dimensionality in training data such as PCA: it projects training data into a smaller dimension to decrease the model complexity.
Stop the training early when the performance on the testing dataset has not improved after a number of training iterations.
QUESTION 2 OF 4

It is learning the training data too well at the expense of not generalizing well to new data.
It highly simplifies assumptions on the target function.
It has a high variance.

Data Import and Transformation
Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and transforming data to make it more appropriate for data analysis. The process generally follows these main steps:
Explore the raw data and check the general quality of the dataset.
Transform the raw data, by restructuring, normalizing, and cleaning the data. For example, this could involve handling missing values and detecting errors.
Validate and publish the data.
Data wrangling is an iterative process where you do some data transformation then check the results and come back to the process to make improvements.

Managing Data
As we just discussed, Azure Machine Learning has two data management tools that we need to consider: Datastores and datasets. At first the distinction between the two may not be entirely clear, so let's have a closer look at what each one does and how they are related.
Datastores vs. Datasets
Datastores offer a layer of abstraction over the supported Azure storage services. They store all the information needed to connect to a particular storage service. Datastores provide an access mechanism that is independent of the computer resource that is used to drive a machine learning process.
Datasets are resources for exploring, transforming, and managing data in Azure ML. A dataset is essentially a reference that points to the data in storage. It is used to get specific data files in the datastores.

Dataset
SUBMIT
The Data Access Workflow
The steps of the data access workflow are:
Create a datastore so that you can access storage services in Azure.
Create a dataset, which you will subsequently use for model training in your machine learning experiment.
Create a dataset monitor to detect issues in the data, such as data drift.
In the video, we mentioned the concept of data drift. Over time, the input data that you are feeding into your model is likely to change—and this is what we mean by data drift. Data drift can be problematic for model accuracy. Since you trained the model on a certain set of data, it can become increasingly inaccurate and the data changes more and more over time. For example, if you train a model to detect spam in email, it may become less accurate as new types of spam arise that are different from the spam on which the model was trained.
As we noted in the video, you can set up dataset monitors to detect data drift and other issues in your data. When data drift is detected, you can have the system automatically update the input dataset so that you can retrain the model and maintain its accuracy.

More About Datasets
On the last page, we discussed the main features of datastores and datasets. Now, let's look a little more closely at how datasets work in Azure Machine Learning.
Key points to remember about datasets:
They are used to interact with your data in the datastore and to package data into consumable objects.
They can be created from local files, public URLs, Azure Open Datasets, and files uploaded to the datastores.
They are not copies of the data but references that point to the original data. This means that no extra storage cost is incurred when you create a new dataset.
Once a dataset is registered in Azure ML workspace, you can share it and reuse it across various other experiments without data ingestion complexities.
In summary, here are some of the main things that datasets allow you to do:
Have a single copy of some data in your storage, but reference it multiple times—so that you don't need to create multiple copies each time you need that data available.
Access data during model training without specifying connection strings or data paths.
More easily share data and collaborate with other users.
Bookmark the state of your data by using dataset versioning
You would do versioning most typically when:
New data is available for retraining.
When you are applying different approaches to data preparation or feature engineering.
Keep in mind that there are two dataset types supported in Azure ML Workspace:
The Tabular Dataset, which represents data in a tabular format created by parsing the provided file or list of files.
The Web URL (File Dataset), which references single or multiple files in datastores or from public URLs.
We'll get practice working with these dataset types in the upcoming labs.
QUIZ QUESTION
Which of the following are true statements about Azure Machine Learning datasets?
(Select all that apply.)
Datasets are copies of your data files that are copied by Azure onto your machine as needed.
Datasets are references that point to the data in your storage service; they are not actually copies, so no extra storage cost is incurred.
If you don't have an Azure storage service, you can create a dataset directly from local files, public urls, or an Azure Open Dataset.

Note: We have been referring to this as a data table, but you will also see data in this format called a matrix. The term matrix is commonly used in mathematics, and it refers to a rectangular array—which, just like a table, contains data arranged in rows and columns.
Recall that the columns in a table can be referred to as features. In the above example, color and quantity are features of the products. In the last lesson, we mentioned briefly that feature engineering is an important part of data preparation. In this lesson, we'll look at this topic in more detail.
In many cases, the set of initial features in the data is not enough to produce high quality trained machine learning models. You can use feature engineering to derive new features based on the values of existing features. This process can be as simple as applying a mathematical function to a feature (such as adding 1 to all values in an existing feature ) or it can be as complex as training a separate machine learning model to create values for new features.
Once you have the features, another important task is selecting the features that are most important or most relevant. This process is called feature selection.
Many machine learning algorithms cannot accommodate a large number of features, so it is often necessary to do dimensionality reduction to decrease the number of features.

Feature Selection
There are mainly two reasons for feature selection. Some features might be highly irrelevant or redundant. So it's better to remove these features to simplify the situation and improve performance. Additionally, it may seem like engineering more features is always a good thing, but as we mentioned earlier, many machine learning algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality—that is, they do not perform well when given a large number of variables or features.
We can improve the situation of having too many features through dimensionality reduction.
Commonly used techniques are:
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighboring Entities)
Feature embedding
Azure ML prebuilt modules:
Filter-based feature selection: identify columns in the input dataset that have the greatest predictive power
Permutation feature importance: determine the best features to use by computing the feature importance scores

Data Drift
As we mentioned earlier, data drift is change in the input data for a model. Over time, data drift causes degradation in the model's performance, as the input data drifts farther and farther from the data on which the model was trained.

A sensor is replaced, causing the units of measurement to change (e.g., from minutes to seconds).

SUBMIT
Monitoring for Data Drift
As we noted, data drift is one of the main reasons that model performance gets worse over time. Fortunately, Azure Machine Learning allows you to set up dataset monitors that can alert you about data drift and even take automatic actions to correct data drift.
Remember, the process of monitoring for data drift involves:
Specifying a baseline dataset – usually the training dataset
Specifying a target dataset – usually the input data for the model
Comparing these two datasets over time, to monitor for differences
Here are a couple different types of comparisons you might want to make when monitoring for data drift:
Comparing input data vs. training data. This is a proxy for model accuracy; that is, an increased difference between the input vs. training data is likely to result in a decrease in model accuracy.
Comparing different samples of time series data. In this case, you are checking for a difference between one time period and another. For example, a model trained on data collected during one season may perform differently when given data from another time of year. Detecting this seasonal drift in the data will alert you to potential issues with your model's accuracy.
QUESTION 2 OF 2
Here's the graph of data-drift magnitude that we looked at in the video:

Model Training Basics
In this section, we will get into more detail on the steps involved in training a model, and then we'll get some hands-on practice with the process in the upcoming lab.
Remember that our ultimate goal is to produce a model we can use to make predictions. Put another way, we want to be able to give the model a set of input features, 
X
X, and have it predict the value of some output feature, 
y
y.
Parameters and Hyperparameters
When we train a model, a large part of the process involves learning the values of the parameters of the model. For example, earlier we looked at the general form for linear regression:
y = B_0 + B_1*x_1 + B_2*x_2 + B_3*x_3 ... + B_n *x_n
y=B

, determine the intercept and slope of the regression line. When training a linear regression model, we use the training data to figure out what the value of these parameters should be. Thus, we can say that a major goal of model training is to learn the values of the model parameters.
In contrast, some model parameters are not learned from the data. These are called hyperparameters and their values are set before training. Here are some examples of hyperparameters:
The number of layers in a deep neural network
The number of clusters (such as in a k-means clustering algorithm)
The learning rate of the model
We must choose some values for these hyperparameters, but we do not necessarily know what the best values will be prior to training. Because of this, a common approach is to take a best guess, train the model, and then tune adjust or tune the hyperparameters based on the model's performance.
Splitting the Data
As mentioned in the video, we typically want to split our data into three parts:
Training data
Validation data
Test data
We use the training data to learn the values for the parameters. Then, we check the model's performance on the validation data and tune the hyperparameters until the model performs well with the validation data. For instance, perhaps we need to have more or fewer layers in our neural network. We can adjust this hyperparameter and then test the model on the validation data once again to see if its performance has improved.
Finally, once we believe we have our finished model (with both parameters and hyperparameters optimized), we will want to do a final check of its performance—and we need to do this on some fresh test data that we did not use during the training process.

Training Classifiers
As we described in the last lesson, two of the main types of supervised learning are classification and regression. In this section, we'll get some practice training both of these types of models. But first, let's discuss the concepts in more detail—starting with classification.
In a classification problem, the outputs are categorical or discrete.
For example, you might want to classify emails as spam or not spam; each of these is a discrete category.
QUIZ QUESTION
As we described in the video, there are three main types of classification problem. Can you mark which type each of these examples belongs to?

Training Regressors
Now let us turn to regression. The main distinction that sets a regression problem apart from a classification problem is the form of the output:
In a regression problem, the output is numerical or continuous.
A classic example would be a problem in which you are given data concerning houses and then asked to predict the price; this is a regression problem because price is a continuous, numerical output.
QUIZ QUESTION
Suppose that you want to predict the probability that a user will like classical music. What type of problem would this be?
Classification

Regression to values between 0 and 1

Evaluating Model Performance
It is not enough to simply train a model on some data and then assume that the model will subsequently perform well on future data. Instead, as we've mentioned previously, we need to split off a portion of our labeled data and reserve it for evaluating our model's final performance. We refer to this as the test dataset.
The test dataset is a portion of labeled data that is split off and reserved for model evaluation.
If a model learns to perform well with the training data, but performs poorly with the test data, then there may be a problem that we will need to address before putting our model out into the real world. In practice, we will also need to decide what metrics we will use to evaluate performance, and whether there are any particular thresholds that the model needs to meet on these metrics in order for us to decide that it is "good enough."
When splitting the available data, it is important to preserve the statistical properties of that data. This means that the data in the training, validation, and test datasets need to have similar statistical properties as the original data to prevent bias in the trained model.
QUIZ QUESTION
A researcher has collected datasets from two neighboring cities in order to develop a model that predicts the sale price of a house based on various features. Which of the following approaches would be best for this researcher?
Split the data by city, so that data for the first city is used to train the model, and data for the second city is used to evaluate the model.
Use all of the data for training the model, as this will result in greater power and the best possible model optimization.
Split the data randomly, so that some houses from each city are included in both the training dataset and the test dataset.

Confusion Matrices
Suppose that we have trained a simple binary classification model: Given an image, this model will indicate whether it is a picture of a cat or a picture of a dog. How can we evaluate our model's performance? What is a good metric for doing so?
Let us first consider what it means for the model to perform well. If the model tells us an image has a dog in it and that image actually has a dog, we would say it performs well. And similarly, if it says that the image has a cat and it actually has a cat that would also be good.
To help us think about the problem, we can construct a table that shows all of the possibilities:

As you can see, the columns here represent the actual class—that is, whether an image actually has a dog or a cat. The rows represent the predicted class—that is, whether the model concludes that an image has a dog or a cat. When the predicted class matches the actual class (e.g., the model says the image has a cat and the image does indeed have a cat), this is a correct classification.
QUESTION 1 OF 3
We can use a table like this to organize our model's output. Suppose that we give the classifier test data containing 10 images, and the results are as follows:

How well has the model performed?
The model performed perfectly—there were no misclassified images at all
The model performed well, though not perfectly—there were a few misclassified images
The model performed poorly—most of the images were misclassified
The model performed very badly—it misclassified all of the images
SUBMIT
QUESTION 2 OF 3
OK, here is a different set of results:

How well has the model performed this time?
The model performed perfectly—there were no misclassified images at all
The model performed quite well, though not perfectly—there were a few misclassified images
The model performed poorly—most of the images were misclassified
The model performed very badly—it misclassified all of the images
SUBMIT
The key is to look at the diagonals. If the upper left and lower right cells are high relative to the others, then the model is making more correct classifications than incorrect classifications:

Whereas if the upper right and lower left cells are comparatively higher, the model is making more incorrect classifications:

This type of table is called a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix gets its name from the fact that it is easy to see whether the model is getting confused and misclassifying the data.
You will often see the confusion matrix represented in a more general, abstract form that uses the terms positive and negative:

True positives are the positive cases that are correctly predicted as positive by the model
False positives are the negative cases that are incorrectly predicted as positive by the model
True negatives are the negative cases that are correctly predicted as negative by the model
False negatives are the positive cases that are incorrectly predicted as negative by the model
QUESTION 3 OF 3
Which one of the following is incorrect about confusion matrices?
The sum of TN and FN tells us the number of cases predicted as negative by the model
The sum FP and TP tells us the number of actual positive cases in the dataset
The sum of FP and TN tells us the number of actual negative cases in the datasets
The sum of TP and TN tells us the number of cases correctly predicted by the model

Evaluation Metrics for Regression
If you recall, classification yields discrete outputs (e.g., cat vs dog or positive vs. negative), while regression yields continuous, numerical outputs (e.g., 3.229, 23 minutes, $17.78).
Not surprisingly then, we need a different set of metrics for evaluating regression models. Let's have a look.
Again, note that with regression metrics, we are using functions that in some way calculate the numerical difference between the predicted vs. expected values.

Strength in Numbers
Remember, no matter how well-trained an individual model is, there is still a significant chance that it could perform poorly or produce incorrect results. Rather than relying on a single model, you can often get better results by training multiple models or using multiple algorithms and in some way capturing the collective results. As we mentioned, there are two main approaches to this: Ensemble learning and automated machine learning. Let's have a closer look at each of them.
Ensemble Learning
Remember, ensemble learning combines multiple machine learning models to produce one predictive model. There are three main types of ensemble algorithms:
Bagging or bootstrap aggregation
Helps reduce overfitting for models that tend to have high variance (such as decision trees)
Uses random subsampling of the training data to produce a bag of trained models.
The resulting trained models are homogeneous
The final prediction is an average prediction from individual models
Boosting
Helps reduce bias for models.
In contrast to bagging, boosting uses the same input data to train multiple models using different hyperparameters.
Boosting trains model in sequence by training weak learners one by one, with each new learner correcting errors from previous learners
The final predictions are a weighted average from the individual models
Stacking
Trains a large number of completely different (heterogeneous) models
Combines the outputs of the individual models into a meta-model that yields more accurate predictions
Strength in Variety: Automated ML
Automated machine learning, like the name suggests, automates many of the iterative, time-consuming, tasks involved in model development (such as selecting the best features, scaling features optimally, choosing the best algorithms, and tuning hyperparameters). Automated ML allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build models with greater scale, efficiency, and productivity—all while sustaining model quality.

In this context, you learned about ensemble learning and automated machine learning. You've learned how the two differ, yet apply the same general principle of "strength in numbers". In the process, you trained an ensemble model (a decision forest) and a straightforward classifier using automated Machine Learning.

Supervised Learning: Classification
The first type of supervised learning that we'll look at is classification. Recall that the main distinguishing characteristic of classification is the type of output it produces:
In a classification problem, the outputs are categorical or discrete.
Within this broad definition, there are several main approaches, which differ based on how many classes or categories are used, and whether each output can belong to only one class or multiple classes. Let's have a look.
Some of the most common types of classification problems include:
Classification on tabular data: The data is available in the form of rows and columns, potentially originating from a wide variety of data sources.
Classification on image or sound data: The training data consists of images or sounds whose categories are already known.
Classification on text data: The training data consists of texts whose categories are already known.
As we discussed in a previous lesson, machine learning requires numerical data. This means that with images, sound, and text, several steps need to be performed during the preparation phase to transform the data into numerical vectors that can be accepted by the classification algorithms.

Unsupervised Learning
All of the algorithms we have looked at so far are examples of supervised learning, in which the training data is labeled. For example, if we are training a classifier to recognize an image of a cat, we might have some images in our training dataset that we already know have cats—and are labeled as such.
But the cost of obtaining labeled data can be high. So now let's turn our attention to the second main type of machine learning explored in this lesson: unsupervised learning.
In unsupervised learning, algorithms learn from unlabeled data by looking for hidden structures in the data.
Obtaining unlabeled data is comparatively inexpensive and unsupervised learning can be used to uncover very useful information in such data. For example, we can use clustering algorithms to discover implicit grouping within the data, or use association algorithms to discover hidden rules that are governing the data (e.g., people who buy product A also tend to buy product B).

Semi-Supervised Learnining
Sometimes fully labeled data cannot be obtained, or is too expensive—but at the same time, it may be possible to get partially labeled data. This is where semi-supervised learning is useful.
Semi-supervised learning combines the supervised and unsupervised approaches; typically it involves having small amounts of labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data.
QUIZ QUESTION
Which of these best describes self training?
The model is trained with the labeled data, then used to make predictions for the unlabeled data (resulting in a dataset that is fully labeled).
Multiple models are trained on different views of the data (e.g., different feature selections, model architectures, etc.).
A single model is trained on different views of the data (e.g., different feature selections, model architectures, etc.).

The resulting numerical representation, which is usually in the form of vectors, can then be used as an input to a wide range of classification algorithms.
Training a Classification Model with Text
As we mentioned in the video, an important part of the pipeline is the process of vectorizing the text, using a technique such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. We discussed text vectorization in some detail back in the introduction lesson when we described text data—so you may want to go back to that section if you feel like you need a review of the concept.

Let's have a look at how this technique works.

Datasets often contain a small number of items that deviate significantly from the norm. These anomalies can be of interest, since they may be the result of bad data, unusual behavior, or important exceptions to the typical trends. Anomaly detection is a machine learning technique concerned with finding these data points.

Remember, forecasting is a class of problems that deals with predictions in the context of orderable datasets. These orderable datasets can be time-series datasets, but they don't have to be—forecasting can be applied to other types of orderable sets as well.

Lesson Overview
This lesson covers managed services for Machine Learning, which are services you use to enhance your Machine Learning processes. We will use services provided by Azure Machine Learning as examples throughout the lesson.
You will learn about various types of computing resources made available through managed services, including:
Training compute
Inferencing compute
Notebook environments
You will also study the main concepts involved in the modeling process, including:
Basic modeling
How parts of the modeling process interact when used together
More advanced aspects of the modeling process, like automation via pipelines and end-to-end integrated processes (also known as DevOps for Machine Learning or simply, MLOps)
How to move the results of your modeling work to production environments and make them operational
Finally, you will be introduced to the world of programming the managed services via the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python.
Managed Services for Machine Learning
The machine learning process can be labor intensive. Machine learning requires a number of tools to prepare the data, train the models, and deploy the models. Most of the work usually takes place within web-based, interactive notebooks, such as Jupyter notebooks. Although notebooks are lightweight and easily run in a web browser, you still need a server to to host them. Typically, this involves installing several applications and libraries on a machine, configuring the environment settings, and then loading any additional resources required to begin working within notebooks or integrated development environments (IDEs).
All this setup takes time, and there is sometimes a fair amount of troubleshooting involved to make sure you have the right combination of software versions that are compatible with one another. This is the advantage of managed services for machine learning, which provide a ready-made environment that is pre-optimized for your machine learning development.

Compute Resources
A compute target is a designated compute resource or environment where you run training scripts or host your service deployment. There are two different variations on compute targets that we will discuss below: training compute targets and inferencing compute targets.
Training Compute
First, let's talk about compute resources that can be used for model training.
Inferencing Compute
Once you have a trained model, you'll want to be able to deploy it for inferencing. Let's take a look at the compute resources you can use for different types of inferencing.
QUIZ QUESTION
Which of the following compute targets are not managed by Azure Machine Learning?
Compute instance
Azure Container Instances
Compute clusters
SUBMIT
NEXT
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
correct!
Azure Container Instances are not managed by Azure Machine Learning. A managed compute resource is created and managed by Azure Machine Learning. This type of compute is optimized for machine learning workloads. Azure Machine Learning compute clusters and compute instances are the only managed computes.
Managed Notebook Environments
Notebooks are made up of one or more cells that allow for the execution of the code snippets or commands within those cells. They store commands and the results of running those commands. In this diagram, you can see that we can use a notebook environment to perform the five primary stages of model development:

The best way to understand how managed notebook environments work is to jump in and work with one—so that's what we'll do in the next lab, by training a simple SciKit learn model on a medical dataset.

Basic Modeling
Training, evaluating, and selecting the right Machine Learning models is at the core of each modern data science process. But what concrete steps do we need to go through to produce a trained model? In this section, we'll look at some important parts of the process and how we can use Azure Machine Learning to carry them out.
Experiments
Before you create a new run, you must first create an experiment. Remember, an experiment is a generic context for handling runs. Think about it as a logical entity you can use to organize your model training processes.
Runs
Once you have an experiment, you can create runs within that experiment. As we discussed above, model training runs are what you use to build the trained model. A run contains all artifacts associated with the training process, like output files, metrics, logs, and a snapshot of the directory that contains your scripts.
Models
A run is used to produce a model. Essentially, a model is a piece of code that takes an input and produces output. To get a model, we start with a more general algorithm. By combining this algorithm with the training data—as well as by tuning the hyperparameters—we produce a more specific function that is optimized for the particular task we need to do. Put concisely:
Model = algorithm + data + hyperparameters
Model Registry
Once we have a trained model, we can turn to the model registry, which keeps track of all models in an Azure Machine Learning workspace. Note that models are either produced by a Run or originate from outside of Azure Machine Learning (and are made available via model registration).
QUIZ QUESTION
When you train a model in Azure Machine Learning, there are a few steps you must perform, in a particular order. Which of these shows the correct order?
Create a new run in code, create a new experiment after the run is completed, then register the trained model.
Start out by creating a new registry for the model. Next, create a new experiment and add a run to it. The model is automatically associated to its registration.
Create a new experiment for your runs. Submit a script run. After the run successfully completes, register the model.
SUBMIT
NEXT
Correct!
An experiment is a generic context for handling and organizing runs. Once you have an experiment, you'll want to create one or more runs within it, until you identify the best model. You then register the final model in a model registry. After registration, you can then download or deploy the registered model and receive all the files that were registered.
 
 
 
 
Advanced Modeling
Machine Learning Pipelines
As the process of building your models becomes more complex, it becomes more important to get a handle on the steps to prepare your data and train your models in an organized way. In these scenarios, there can be many steps involved in the end-to-end process, including:
Data ingestion
Data preparation
Model building & training
Model deployment.
These steps are organized into machine learning pipelines.
MLOps: Creating Automatic End-to-End Integrated Processes
As we said earlier, we don't want all the steps in the machine learning pipeline to be manual—rather, we want to develop processes that use automated builds and deployments. The general term for this approach is DevOps; when applied to machine learning, we refer to the automation of machine learning pipelines as MLOps.
NEXT
 
Operationalizing Models
After you have trained your machine learning model and evaluated it to the point where you are ready to use it outside your own development or test environment, you need to deploy it somewhere. Another term for this is operationalization.
Real-time Inferencing
The model training process can be very compute-intensive, with training times that can potentially spann across many hours, days, or even weeks. A trained model, on the other hand, is used to make decisions on new data quickly. In other words, it infers things about new data it is given based on its training. Making these decisions on new data on-demand is called real-time inferencing.
Batch Inferencing
Unlike real-time inferencing, which makes predictions on data as it is received, batch inferencing is run on large quantities (batches) of existing data. Typically, batch inferencing is run on a recurring schedule against data stored in a database or other data store.
QUIZ QUESTION
When you deploy a Machine Learning model used for real-time scoring, or batch inferencing, there are several steps you must follow. Select the required steps in the list below.
(Select all that apply.)
Save and retrieve the model file in any format
Create a metadata file that describes the model
Create a training script
Create a scoring script
Create a schema file that describes the web service input
Create a real-time scoring web service

Programmatically Accessing Managed Services
Azure Machine Learning provides a code-first experience via the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python. Using the SDK, you can start training your models on your local machine and then scale out to use Azure Machine Learning compute resources. This allows you to train better performing, highly accurate machine learning models.
Azure Machine Learning service supports many of the popular open-source machine learning and deep learning Python packages that we discussed earlier in the course, such as:
Scikit-learn
Tensorflow
PyTorch
Keras
In the next lab, we'll get some practice using Azure ML Python SDK to register, package, and deploy a trained model.
